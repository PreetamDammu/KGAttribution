[2024-02-12 22:02:57] Failed to generate GPT response for prompt: 
Given the input sentence and the following relational paths, retain only the paths that are relevant to the input sentence.
Relevant paths are those that can help provide any useful information about the input sentence.

A relational path is a list of set of triplets in which the tail of each fact corresponds to the head of the next one. 

The valid relational paths are given are numbered and given as options. 

Input sentence:  New ethnic conflicts emerged in Africa , the Balkans and the Caucasus , the former two which led to the Rwandan genocide and Bosnian genocide , respectively.

Relational paths:
Relational Path 1: ('რუსეთ-ოსმალეთის ომის კავკასიის ფრონტი (1877-1878)', 'location', 'Caucasus')('რუსეთ-ოსმალეთის ომის კავკასიის ფრონტი (1877-1878)', 'part of', 'Tenth Russo-Turkish War')('Tenth Russo-Turkish War', 'location', 'Balkans') 
 

Return only the relevant paths. If there are no relevant paths, return "No relevant paths". More than one path may be relevant.
Generate an explanation for the selected relational path.


Format your response as follows: #Relational Path: <number># [Subset of relevant triplets] *Explanation: <explanation>*

Given the input sentence and the following relational paths, retain only the paths that are relevant to the input sentence.
Relevant paths are those that can help provide any useful information about the input sentence.

A relational path is a list of set of triplets in which the tail of each fact corresponds to the head of the next one. 

The valid relational paths are given are numbered and given as options. 

Input sentence:  Every arm of Germany's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics that led to the genocides, turning the Third Reich into what one Holocaust scholar has called "a genocidal state".

Relational paths:
Relational Path 1: ('discours du Président de la République à la 73e Assemblée générale des Nations unies', 'depicts', 'genocide')('discours du Président de la République à la 73e Assemblée générale des Nations unies', 'depicts', 'hyperpower')('hyperpower', 'subclass of', 'state') 
 Relational Path 2: ('genocide of indigenous peoples', 'subclass of', 'genocide')('genocide of indigenous peoples', 'on focus list of Wikimedia project', 'WikiProject Human Rights')('state', 'on focus list of Wikimedia project', 'WikiProject Human Rights') 
 

Return only the relevant paths. If there are no relevant paths, return "No relevant paths". More than one path may be relevant.
Generate an explanation for the selected relational path.


Format your response as follows: #Relational Path: <number># [Subset of relevant triplets] *Explanation: <explanation>*

[2024-02-13 12:38:40] Failed to generate GPT response for prompt: 
Given the input sentence and the following relational paths, retain only the paths that are relevant to the input sentence.
Relevant paths are those that can help provide any useful information about the input sentence.

A relational path is a list of set of triplets in which the tail of each fact corresponds to the head of the next one. 

The valid relational paths are given are numbered and given as options. 

Input sentence:  While the international community is rebuilding war-torn Afghanistan, terrorist groups such as the Haqqani Network and Hezbi Islami are actively involved in a nationwide Taliban -led insurgency , which includes hundreds of assassinations and suicide attacks .

Relational paths:
Relational Path 1: ('2015 Bagram suicide bombing', 'instance of', 'suicide attack')('2015 Bagram suicide bombing', 'country', 'Afghanistan') 
 Relational Path 2: ('suicide bombing', 'subclass of', 'suicide attack')('2016 Kabul suicide bombing', 'instance of', 'suicide bombing')('2016 Kabul suicide bombing', 'country', 'Afghanistan') 
 Relational Path 3: ('Camp Chapman attack', 'instance of', 'suicide attack')('Camp Chapman attack', 'country', 'Afghanistan') 
 

Return only the relevant paths. If there are no relevant paths, return "No relevant paths". More than one path may be relevant.
Generate an explanation for the selected relational path.


Format your response as follows: #Relational Path: <number># [Subset of relevant triplets] *Explanation: <explanation>*

Given the input sentence and the following relational paths, retain only the paths that are relevant to the input sentence.
Relevant paths are those that can help provide any useful information about the input sentence.

A relational path is a list of set of triplets in which the tail of each fact corresponds to the head of the next one. 

The valid relational paths are given are numbered and given as options. 

Input sentence:  The My Lai Massacre ( , ; , , or ) was the Vietnam War mass murder of between 347 and 504 unarmed civilians in South Vietnam on March 16, 1968, by United States Army soldiers of "Charlie" Company of 1st Battalion , 20th Infantry Regiment , 11th Brigade of the Americal Division .
