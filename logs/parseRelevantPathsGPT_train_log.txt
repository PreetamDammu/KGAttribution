[2024-02-12 22:02:57] Failed to generate GPT response for prompt: 
Given the input sentence and the following relational paths, retain only the paths that are relevant to the input sentence.
Relevant paths are those that can help provide any useful information about the input sentence.

A relational path is a list of set of triplets in which the tail of each fact corresponds to the head of the next one. 

The valid relational paths are given are numbered and given as options. 

Input sentence:  New ethnic conflicts emerged in Africa , the Balkans and the Caucasus , the former two which led to the Rwandan genocide and Bosnian genocide , respectively.

Relational paths:
Relational Path 1: ('რუსეთ-ოსმალეთის ომის კავკასიის ფრონტი (1877-1878)', 'location', 'Caucasus')('რუსეთ-ოსმალეთის ომის კავკასიის ფრონტი (1877-1878)', 'part of', 'Tenth Russo-Turkish War')('Tenth Russo-Turkish War', 'location', 'Balkans') 
 

Return only the relevant paths. If there are no relevant paths, return "No relevant paths". More than one path may be relevant.
Generate an explanation for the selected relational path.


Format your response as follows: #Relational Path: <number># [Subset of relevant triplets] *Explanation: <explanation>*

Given the input sentence and the following relational paths, retain only the paths that are relevant to the input sentence.
Relevant paths are those that can help provide any useful information about the input sentence.

A relational path is a list of set of triplets in which the tail of each fact corresponds to the head of the next one. 

The valid relational paths are given are numbered and given as options. 

Input sentence:  Every arm of Germany's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics that led to the genocides, turning the Third Reich into what one Holocaust scholar has called "a genocidal state".

Relational paths:
Relational Path 1: ('discours du Président de la République à la 73e Assemblée générale des Nations unies', 'depicts', 'genocide')('discours du Président de la République à la 73e Assemblée générale des Nations unies', 'depicts', 'hyperpower')('hyperpower', 'subclass of', 'state') 
 Relational Path 2: ('genocide of indigenous peoples', 'subclass of', 'genocide')('genocide of indigenous peoples', 'on focus list of Wikimedia project', 'WikiProject Human Rights')('state', 'on focus list of Wikimedia project', 'WikiProject Human Rights') 
 

Return only the relevant paths. If there are no relevant paths, return "No relevant paths". More than one path may be relevant.
Generate an explanation for the selected relational path.


Format your response as follows: #Relational Path: <number># [Subset of relevant triplets] *Explanation: <explanation>*
